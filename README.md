# CHAPTERS

-   An offline web-based video player that can be used like YouTube.   
-   You can use this app like any other app but for the browser. You dont need any installation, you just need to download and create a shortcut to your desktop and you can now enjoy the app.  
-   This project intends to help the programmers whose just started programming and doesn't have stable internet connection to sustain YouTube consumptions.

## :fire: New Features :fire:

-   We have optimized the usage of CPU and RAM to allow usage on low-end computers

-   Manually copypasting timestamps no longer needed. You can now paste the url of YouTube video you want to have timestamps in the add chapters textarea
-   You can now have easy access to the app by opening the chapters folder and run the chapters.bat 

## Features

-   Able to run locally or Offline
-   Chapters/Key Moments like YouTube
-   Theatre mode
-   Fullscreen mode
-   File crawler
-   Easy access
-   Optimized CPU and RAM usage

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iAmWayneBenedict/chapters.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn install
```
or 

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  yarn start
```

or

```bash
  npm run start
```

You can also build an application file and create shortcut to your desktop, run this command

```bash
  yarn build
```
Then, an application file is created named `chapters.exe` in the root directory. You can now create a shortcut to your desktop

or use the batch file named `chapters.bat` to create a shortcut

### Note

The batch file `chapters.bat` consumes more cpu and ram usage compared to the application file

### To configure the files

-   Copy the env file and paste it as .env, or rename it as .env.  
-   Open public folder and json folder then rename the rename-jsonfile.json to jsonfile.json.

//view all
let viewAll = document.querySelectorAll("#text.style-scope.ytd-button-renderer.style-blue-text");
viewAll[0].click();

//get element
let element = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".style-scope.ytd-watch-flexy"));
element = element.filter((el) => el.id === "panels")[0];

// get items
let items = element.querySelectorAll(
	".yt-simple-endpoint.style-scope.ytd-macro-markers-list-item-renderer"
);
items = Array.from(items).filter((el) => el.id === "endpoint");

let data = [];
let titleStart = "";
let isRepeated = false;
items.map((el, index) => {
